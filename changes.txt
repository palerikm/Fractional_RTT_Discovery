- Renamed draft to "Measurement of Fractional Loss and RTT using STUN"
This better reflects what the draft actually describes.
Rewrote Abstract to reflect those changes

- Renamed attribute PATH-CHARACTERISTIC to
  TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER
Again to better reflect what the attribute actually does. Also
  adjusted the field names in the attribute.

- Renamed section "Path characteristics determination mechanism" ->
  "Measuring Fractional Loss and RTT"

- Down played how ICE should use it. Only hints that this is usefull
  information for ICE like functinality.

- Fix re-transmit vs transmits (off by one problem)

- Added wording regarding passive listening in the security section
(Kathleens comment)

- Removed from security section
"Unauthenticated STUN message MUST NOT include
 the TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute in order to prevent
 on-path attacker from influencing decision-making."
An on-path attacker coul do much worse thing to the (s)RTP packets
onece media is flowing. 
(Also commented by Stpephen)

- Fixed examples in section 3.3 (Alissas comments)

- Added " However if this
        information is collected as network metrics from several
        clients over a longer time period it will be easier to detect
        a pattern."
THis atribute infrmation is useful from a mtrics and analytics
        perspective to detect potential network problems. 
This in addition to adding text throughout that the loss direction
        shoudld be treated as a hint is aimed at resolving SHures
        DISCUSS. 


Removed use-cases section. Did not provide value and only served to
limit the possible uses of the mechanism. (The section did serve its
purpose in a draft explaining in detail why). This creates a backward
dependecy I do not think is necessary. It is up to ICE, MPRTP etc to
really decide if this is something they should use.
